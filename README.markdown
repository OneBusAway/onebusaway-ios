# OBAKit

<img src="WebResources/OBAKit-Logo-Web.png" alt="OBAKit">

OBAKit is a total rewrite of OneBusAway for iOS in the Swift programming language.

## Purpose and Goals

* This codebase is built as a set of reusable frameworks, which can be used to make new apps or augment existing apps on a wide variety of platforms.
* This codebase is meant to provide an easy way for transit agencies to create their own custom-branded transit apps without needing to fork the OneBusAway source code.
* This codebase is intended to be easy to understand, test, and maintain. We try to emphasize clarity over cleverness, even at the risk of being somewhat more verbose at times.

## Quick Start

This project requires [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) to generate Xcode project files. Third-party dependencies are installed via Xcode's Swift Package Manager.

See [wiki/Get-Started](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-ios/wiki/Get-Started) for instructions.

## White Labeling

The iOS codebase is a white-label product, read more about white-labeling at [wiki/White-Label](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-ios/wiki/White-Label).

### Custom Regions

You can quickly add a custom region to the app by creating a specially formed link and then tapping on it in Mobile Safari:

Example:

```
onebusaway://add-region?name=Unitrans&oba-url=https%3A%2F%2Fonebusaway-unitrans.onrender.com%2F
```

Breaking it down:

* Scheme: `onebusaway`
* Host: `add-region`
* Query Params:
    * `name` - the name of the region
    * `oba-url` - the URL encoded address of the server

## Internationalization and Localization

_Note: There's a lot more to be written on this topic. Don't hesitate to ask questions if something is wrong or confusing._

We are using Transifex to localize OneBusAway. You can help out by visiting [the OBA page on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/open-transit-software-foundation/onebusaway-ios/).

Install the Transifex command line client (`tx`) by following the instructions here: https://docs.transifex.com/client/installing-the-client

Use `tx` by following the instructions here: https://docs.transifex.com/client/introduction

Get an API token to use with `tx` by following the instructions here: https://docs.transifex.com/account/authentication

Fetch updated strings from Transifex by running the command `scripts/tx_pull`.

`tx_pull` extracts the full list of localizations that are specified in `app_shared.yml`, and requests the latest list of strings for each language from Transifex by calling `tx pull -l {LANG CODE}` under the hood.

## Objective-C Compatibility

OBAKit is written almost entirely in Swift, with the exception of a few small, ancillary pieces of code. This project is designed to be usable within both Swift and Objective-C projects. Please open an issue for scenarios encountered where you are unable to effectively use the framework generated by this project in Objective-C code.

## Documentation

This project uses [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/) and [Sourcekitten](https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten) to generate its documentation. To rebuild documentation, you will first need to have both projects installed:

```bash
bundle install
brew install sourcekitten
```

Once you have the necessary tools installed, you can regenerate documentation by running the command:

```bash
scripts/docs
```

Configuration data for the Jazzy-generated documentation can be found in the file `.jazzy.json` in the root of the repository.

## How-To's

### Protobuf

To make modifications to the local copy of `gtfs-realtime.proto`, you will need to install some new tools via the `brew` command:

```bash
brew install protobuf
brew install swift-protobuf
```

Now, replace the file `OBAKitCore/Models/Protobuf/gtfs-realtime.proto` with the updated version, and run `scripts/proto-gen.sh` from the project root.

You can find the latest version of the GTFS-RT protobuf file in the https://github.com/google/transit/ repository.

### Update macOS/Xcode versions for GitHub Actions CI

1. Find the latest version of macOS and Xcode here: https://github.com/actions/runner-images/tree/main/images/macos
2. Update the `.github/obakittests.yml` file accordingly.
3. [There's no step 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihOxl1v5BRk).

### Fix "Missing package product" build errors

In Xcode: File Menu -> Packages -> Reset Package Caches

### Update Your App's Package.resolved file

Run the script `scripts/update_package_resolved`

### Figure out why SPM dependencies aren't loading correctly

Run this command from the terminal:

```
xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies
```
